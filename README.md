# spoken_ner_de

This repository contains German language NER annotations plus the guidelines used.

Several data ses were annotated: 

(a) biographic narrative interviews
(b) news-related teaser tweets
(c) a sample of the GermEval 2014 NER Shared task for German

Datasets (b) and (c) are available from this repository.

We will make dataset (a) available at: http://agd.ids-mannheim.de/isw-ner.shtml

The guidelines we applied are inspired by the OntoNotes 5.0 inventory.
